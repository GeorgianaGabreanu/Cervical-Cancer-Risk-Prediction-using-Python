## This project was built following Coursera-guided projects: Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction using Machine Learning. 

Based on the Coursera guided-project:
https://www.coursera.org/projects/cervical-cancer-risk-prediction-using-machine-learning

An open-source database was downloaded from Machine Learning Repository website: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php - Cervical cancer (Risk Factors).csv

Relevant paper: Kelwin Fernandes, Jaime S. Cardoso, and Jessica Fernandes. 'Transfer Learning with Partial Observability Applied to Cervical Cancer Screening.' Iberian Conference on Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis. Springer International Publishing, 2017.

The project is meant to investigate the correlation between Cervical Cancer and risk factors and to build a machine-learning algorithm to predict cervical cancer.

The database consists of 857 woman patients and a series of potential risk factors such as age, pregnancies, previous diagnostic of STD, smoking, biopsy and cytology information.  

The database was downloaded in the terminal using the wget function and the necessary Phyton projects were imported into the project. First, exploratory data analysis was performed (descriptive statistics) and then data visualisation.
