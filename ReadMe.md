## This project was built following Coursera-guided projects: Cervical Cancer Risk Prediction using Machine Learning. 

An open-source database was downloaded from Machine Learning Repository and used for analyses. This database can be found at the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php - Cervical cancer (Risk Factors).csv

The project is meant to investigate the correlation between Cervical Cancer and risk factors and to build a machine-learning algorithm to predict cervical cancer.

The database contains 857 woman patients and a series of potential risk factors such as age, pregnancies, previous diagnostic of STD, smoking, biopsy and cytology information.  

The database was downloaded in the terminal using the wget function and the necessary Phyton projects were imported into the project. First, exploratory data analysis was performed (descriptive statistics) and then data visualisation.
